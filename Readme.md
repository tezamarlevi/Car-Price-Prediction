# **Price Prediction**

## Car Price Prediction
In this project I created a regression model to predict the price of a car in a company.

1. Make a car price prediction for a Rockstar Automotive company.
2. In this case I use 4 machine learning algorithms namely Lasso Regression, SVM Regressor, K-Nearest Neighbor Regression and Ridge Regression.
3. The metric used in this case is Mean Absolute Error, because I want to measure how much error is received by the model.
4. The best model in this case is K-Nearest Neighbor Regression.
5. Libraries used by Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
